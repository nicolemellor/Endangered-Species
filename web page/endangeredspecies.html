		<h2>Is it Real?</h2> 
		<br  />
		<p>The Amur Leopard is an extraordinarily
		 real animal! Amur leopards are the only Panthera pardus subspecies adapted to a cold snowy climate.
		It is a leopard subspecies native to the Primorye region of southeastern Russia and the 
		Jilin Province of northeast China.
		</p>
		 <!-- This paragraph explains the amur leopard and description/characteristics-->
		<br  />
		<h2>What Exactly is a Amur Leopard?</h2> 
		<br  />
		<p>The Amur leopards differ from other subspecies with a thick coat of spot-covered
		  fur. They show the strongest and most consistent divergence in their pattern. There winter 
		  coat varies from fairly light yellow to dense yellowish-red with a golden tinge or 
		  rusty-reddish-yellow. The summer coat they show is brighter with more vivid coloration pattern.
		 Compared with other leopard subspecies, they are rather small in size, with males larger 
		   than females. Males have  a weight of 32.2–48 kg (71–106 lb) while females and a weight 
		   of 32.2–48 kg (71–106 lb). Amur leopards have long limbs and are well adapted to walking 
		   through deep snow.</p>

		<p>The amur leopard is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List. In 2007,
		 with only 19–26 wild Amur leopards were estimated to survive. As of 2015, fewer than 
		 60 individuals are estimated to survive in Russia and China. There beautiful fur coat makes
		 them a prime source for poaching.</p>
		<br  />
		<p> Poaching of these leopards is a main threat to their survival. There are 
		rumors but no evidence that Chinese traders buy there skins, but no skins were 
		confiscated at borders to China. Although from February 2002 to April 2003, 
		seven skins or part of skins were confiscated, six in Russia and one in China.
		Leopards are most often killed by local Russians from small villages who hunt entirely 
		illegally, hunting without licenses for there guns or hunting leases. Significant progress
	 in conserving Amur tigers and leopards has helped create
		<a href="http://www.waza.org/en/site/conservation/waza-conservation-projects/amur-leopard-conservation" >the ALTA</a>.
		This organization is working to replace grasslands, destroyed by fires, that Amur leopards avoid, and establish 
		a second wild leopard population.</p>
